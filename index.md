# Data description
 As a computational project, data will be key to the work. Data regarding known astrophysical jet sources, which includes data such as mass, angular momentum, and metallicity, from different central engines will be used as the simulated progenitor (our initial setup). Such data will be captured from online astronomical catalogues. As a simulated output, light curves (intensity, or total power output over time) and spectra (counts from a source as a function of energy) are the goal as they can be directly compared to observational data. To achieve these numerical results, a 3D SRHD code will be developed using a combination of C++ and Python will be developed, as no public code is currently available. Due to the compute intensive nature of these simulations, the code will be developed in such a way that leverages high-performance computing architectures. It is expected that this project will ultimately produce on the order of hundreds of GB of data. 


# Roles and responsibilities
As a computational theorist, the responsibility for data management will fall largely on me as the primary researcher, and to a lesser extent on my advisor, who will provide basic guidance with such things as theoretical and numerical frameworks, common practices, and where to start my literature search. I will be responsible, ultimately, for developing code, managing data, conducting the appropriate data analysis, etc. My advisor, to some extent, will be co-responsible for such things as quality control-- both of the data as well as analysis techniques. Since my research question does not involve the use of human subjects, the data produced by this research project will not be sensitive or confidential; nor is my research under some sort of non-disclosure agreement that would prevent the dissemination of data. However, funding agencies, namely NSF, will require a Data Management Plan during the proposal stage, which will include plans to make data available (talking with my advisor, it appears whether itâ€™s made freely available or made available by request seems to be to the discretion of the researcher).
